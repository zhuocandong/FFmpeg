Here is one test method which checks that the encoder's
view of decoded pictures in the same as the decoder's view.
This ensures that there is no distortion besides what is
inherently caused by compression.

#1.Install and compile xavs :
svn co https://xavs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xavs/trunk xavs 
cd xavs
./configure
make
cd ..

2. use --dump-yuv option to dump the encoding reconstructed frames 
example:
Syntax: xavs [options] -o outfile infile [widthxheight]
./xavs -B 400 -I 60 -b 2 --frames 200 --dump-yuv fenc.yuv 
  -o test.avs football.qcif 176x144

3. Install and compile AVS RM reference decoder :
./ldecod test.avs  # this produces fdec.yuv

4. Compare the fenc.yuv fdec.yuv
